# YTDownloader
Python YouTube Downloader app

This is my attempt at a YouTube video and audio downloader.
I'm making it using Python, Kivy, the PyTubeFix package and Buildozer.
I am making it for personal use.
This app is still under construction, but the Python/Kivy scripts are working, though currently only audio.
The text however is in Dutch.
